# Random

You may be wondering... a repo called Random, what?? What is it supposed to mean... Well, it is just a repository that has the C++ applications that I make when I am bored, for example one with a load of progress bars, one with a RTF box. RTF = Rich Text Format. One with just a load of buttons that do Nothing!
